A GitHub Action and CLI that scans your pull requests for changes likely to break downstream consumers — and generates plain-English migration notes so nobody gets surprised on release day.

## Why?

Every library maintainer has lived this nightmare: you merge a PR, cut a release, and within hours your issue tracker fills up with reports from projects that depended on the function you renamed, the config key you removed, or the default you changed.

**Downstream Breakage Radar** catches those risks *before* they reach `main`. It diffs your branch against a base ref, identifies changes that touch public API surfaces and release-critical files, and tells you — in plain English — what downstream users will need to do.

No external dependencies. No complex setup. Just add it to your workflow and ship with confidence.

## ✨ Features

- 🔍 **Automatic surface detection** — flags changes to `src/`, `lib/`, `api/`, `schemas/`, `proto/`, OpenAPI specs, and more
- 📦 **Package manifest awareness** — catches edits to `pyproject.toml`, `package.json`, `Cargo.toml`, `go.mod`, `pom.xml`, etc.
- 📝 **Migration notes** — every finding includes a human-readable note explaining what to review
- 🎯 **Risk scoring** — summarizes overall risk level (`none` / `low` / `medium` / `high`) at a glance
- 🚨 **Dependency Mismatch Detection** — automatically flags missing imports (critical) or declared-but-unused packages in manifests
- 📊 **Custom SVG Badges** — generates a clean `breakage-radar-badge.svg` representing the overall risk level for your PRs
- ⚠️ **API Deprecation Awareness** — automatically downgrades severity of removals if the code was marked as deprecated first
- 🛡️ **SARIF Format** — supports standardized SARIF output for GitHub's native Security/Code Scanning dashboard integration
- 📝 **API Changelog Generator** — generates a clean markdown changelog of all public additions, removals, and changes
- ⚙️ **In-Manifest Configuration** — manage rules, ignored paths, and custom directories directly inside `pyproject.toml` or `breakage-radar.json`
- 🖥️ **Dual mode** — runs as a GitHub Action in CI *or* locally as a CLI
- 📊 **Multiple output formats** — plain text, JSON, markdown PR comments, SARIF, or GitHub Actions annotations
- 🪶 **Zero dependencies** — pure Python, nothing to install beyond the standard library

## 🚀 Quick Start

### As a GitHub Action (recommended)

Add this to `.github/workflows/breakage-radar.yml`:

```yaml
name: Breakage Radar

on:
  pull_request:

jobs:
  scan:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    permissions:
      contents: read
      pull-requests: write
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v7
        with:
          fetch-depth: 0

      - name: Scan for breaking changes
        uses: Tahiram32/downstream-breakage-radar@v0.5.0
        with:
          base-ref: origin/main
          format: markdown
          fail-on: high
          changelog: true
```

### As a CLI

```bash
# Install from PyPI
pip install downstream-breakage-radar

# Scan the current repo against origin/main
breakage-radar --repo . --base origin/main

# Get JSON output for CI tooling
breakage-radar --repo . --base origin/main --format json

# Generate an API changelog
breakage-radar --repo . --base origin/main --changelog

# Export SARIF for GitHub Code Scanning
breakage-radar --repo . --base origin/main --format sarif > results.sarif
```

Or run directly as a module:

```bash
python -m downstream_breakage_radar.cli --repo . --base origin/main
```

## 📋 Example Output

### Text format

```
Risk level: medium
Changed files: 4
Findings: 3

- [medium] src/api/client.py: Change touches a likely public surface or release-critical file.
  Migration note: Review for API compatibility, config drift, and release notes before merging.

- [low] src/api/client.py: Source code change may affect downstream consumers.
  Migration note: Check for renamed symbols, changed defaults, and behavior shifts.

- [medium] pyproject.toml: Change touches a likely public surface or release-critical file.
  Migration note: Review for API compatibility, config drift, and release notes before merging.
```

### JSON format

```json
{
  "change_count": 4,
  "changed_files": [
    "src/api/client.py",
    "pyproject.toml",
    "docs/guide.md",
    "tests/test_client.py"
  ],
  "finding_count": 3,
  "findings": [
    {
      "message": "Change touches a likely public surface or release-critical file.",
      "migration_note": "Review for API compatibility, config drift, and release notes before merging.",
      "path": "src/api/client.py",
      "severity": "medium"
    }
  ],
  "risk_level": "medium"
}
```

## ⚙️ Configuration

| Input | Default | Description |
|-------|---------|-------------|
| `--repo` | `.` | Path to the Git repository to scan |
| `--base` | `origin/main` | Base ref to diff against (branch, tag, or commit SHA) |
| `--format` | `text` | Output format: `text`, `json`, `markdown`, `github` (inline annotations), or `sarif` |
| `--fail-on` | `high` | The risk level at which to exit with code 1 (`none`, `low`, `medium`, `high`) |
| `--draft-release` | `false` | Automatically draft a GitHub release using the `gh` CLI |
| `--changelog` | `false` | Generate a markdown API changelog (`breakage-radar-changelog.md`) |

### Ignore Files

Create a `.breakageignore` file in the root of your repository to specify glob patterns for paths you want the scanner to completely ignore (e.g. `src/internal_scripts/*` or `*_test.py`).

### In-Manifest Configuration

You can configure the tool directly in your `pyproject.toml`:

```toml
[tool.breakage-radar]
ignored_paths = ["tests/*", "docs/*"]
public_dirs = ["api/", "src/public/"]
severity_overrides = { "Unused Python dependency" = "none" }
```

Or create a `breakage-radar.json` in the root of your repository:

```json
{
  "ignored_paths": ["tests/*", "scripts/*"],
  "public_dirs": ["api/"],
  "severity_overrides": {
    "Unused Python dependency": "none"
  }
}
```

### GitHub Action inputs

When using as a GitHub Action, pass configuration via the `with` keyword. The action requires `fetch-depth: 0` on checkout so the full git history is available for diffing.

## 🔬 How It Works

1. **Diff** — runs `git diff --name-only <base-ref>...HEAD` to get the list of changed files
2. **Multi-Language AST Analysis** — deeply parses:
   - **Python** (`.py`) using the `ast` module — detects removed/renamed functions, deleted classes, changed argument signatures, and deprecation status
   - **Go** (`.go`) — detects removed exported functions, methods, and struct/interface types
   - **JavaScript/TypeScript** (`.js`, `.ts`, `.jsx`, `.tsx`) — detects removed exported functions, classes, constants, and interfaces
3. **Deprecation Check** — if a removed symbol was marked `@deprecated` (Python/JS) or `// Deprecated:` (Go), severity is automatically reduced from `high` to `medium`
4. **Dependency Analysis** — compares declared packages in `pyproject.toml`, `requirements.txt`, or `package.json` against actual imports in code, flagging missing or unused packages
5. **SemVer Recommendation** — reads your current version from manifests and recommends the correct next version bump (`PATCH`, `MINOR`, or `MAJOR`) based on the overall risk level
6. **Score & Report** — assigns a final risk level (`none` / `low` / `medium` / `high`) and generates reports in your choice of Text, JSON, Markdown, SARIF, or GitHub Workflow Command annotations

## 🗺️ Roadmap

- [x] Diff-aware API surface detection (AST-level analysis)

- [x] Automated release-note drafting
- [x] Downstream repository impact hints
- [x] `fail-on` threshold to block PRs above a risk level
- [x] SARIF output for GitHub Security tab integration
